# Substance-Painter-Texture-Exporting-Tool
Scripts for a custom tool meant for large scale game production. Ensures naming conventions and only exports texture sets from Substance Painter that validate naming conventions and texture budget.
Will only export to a specified folder, based on the selected asset name and the selected type of shader.
